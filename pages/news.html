                <p>Drake was one of the most anticipated artists of day 1 of Lollapalooza Argentina 2023. The Canadian artist stepped on Argentine soil to give his first show in the history in our country and, for some, his debut left a bitter taste.<br>
                When after 55 minutes of show Drake said goodbye and left the stage, many of those present were stunned. With half an hour more of concert scheduled, the Canadian did not return to give signs and left in the air the feeling that something strange happened.</p>

                <p>Several weeks ago, through his social networks, Lit Killah had shared photos of his meeting with Ronaldinho in Brazil. What was not known was exactly the reason for his trip to the neighboring country. However, recently the mystery was unveiled.<br>

The title chosen for the single is "Olé, olé" and it features Yandel, the legendary Puerto Rican singer. In addition, the video clip was filmed in different locations in Brazil.
